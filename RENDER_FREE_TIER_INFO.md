## ⏰ The "Sleep" Problem

### What Happens:
1. No requests for 15 minutes → Backend spins down
2. First request after sleep → 30-60 second delay
3. Subsequent requests → Normal speed

### Impact:
- **Development/Testing:** Acceptable
- **Production:** Not ideal for users

### Solutions:

#### Option 1: Keep It Awake (Free)
Use a service like [Cron-job.org](https://cron-job.org) to ping your backend every 14 minutes:

```bash
# Ping this URL every 14 minutes
https://your-backend.onrender.com/actuator/health
```

#### Option 2: Upgrade Backend ($7/month)
Change `plan: free` to `plan: starter` in render.yaml:
```yaml
plan: starter  # $7/month, no sleep
```

---

## 🗄️ The Database Expiration Issue

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Free PostgreSQL expires after 90 days

After 90 days, you must:

**Option 1: Upgrade Database ($7/month)**
```yaml
databases:
  - name: pos-database
    plan: starter  # $7/month, no expiration
```

**Option 2: Migrate to New Free Database**
1. Create new free database before 90 days
2. Export data from old database
3. Import to new database
4. Update backend connection
5. Delete old database

**Option 3: Use External Database**
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com) - Free PostgreSQL
- [Neon](https://neon.tech) - Free PostgreSQL
- [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com) - Free tier available

## 📈 When to Upgrade

### Keep Free If:
- ✅ Just testing/developing
- ✅ Personal project
- ✅ Low traffic expected
- ✅ 30-60s wake-up delay is acceptable
- ✅ You can migrate database every 90 days

### Upgrade Backend ($7/month) If:
- ❌ Can't accept 30-60s delays
- ❌ Need consistent performance
- ❌ Have regular users
- ❌ Want 24/7 availability

### Upgrade Database ($7/month) If:
- ❌ Don't want to migrate every 90 days
- ❌ Need more than 1GB storage
- ❌ Need more than 256MB RAM
- ❌ Running in production

### Recommended Production Setup:
```yaml
Backend: plan: starter    # $7/month
Database: plan: starter   # $7/month
Frontend: plan: free      # $0/month
TOTAL: $14/month
```

### Via render.yaml:
1. Edit render.yaml:
   ```yaml
   plan: free  # Change to: starter, standard, or pro
   ```
2. Commit and push to GitHub
3. Render auto-deploys with new plan

## 💡 Pro Tips for Free Tier

### 1. Monitor Your Usage
- Check Render Dashboard for:
  - Hours used (should stay under 750/month)
  - Bandwidth used (should stay under 100GB/month)
  - Database size (should stay under 1GB)

### 2. Optimize for Free Tier
- **Backend:** Keep it lightweight, optimize startup time
- **Frontend:** Compress images, minimize bundle size
- **Database:** Regular cleanup, remove old data

### 3. Set Reminders
- **60 days:** Start planning database migration/upgrade
- **Monthly:** Check if hours/bandwidth are within limits

### 4. Use Development Mode
- Test locally as much as possible
- Only deploy to Render when ready to test live

### 5. Scale Smartly
- Keep frontend free (always)
- Upgrade backend first ($7/month) if needed
- Upgrade database when you hit 90 days or need more space
