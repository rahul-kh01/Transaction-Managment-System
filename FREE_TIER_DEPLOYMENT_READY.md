## ⚠️ Free Tier Limitations (Important!)

### 1. Backend Sleeps After 15 Minutes
**What it means:**
- No activity for 15 min → Service spins down
- First request after sleep → 30-60 second delay
- Then works normally

**Is this OK for you?**
- ✅ Testing/Development: YES
- ✅ Personal project: YES  
- ❌ Production with users: NO (upgrade to $7/month)

**Quick Fix:** Ping service every 14 minutes (see RENDER_FREE_TIER_INFO.md)

### 2. Database Expires After 90 Days
**What it means:**
- After 90 days, you must either:
  - Upgrade to paid database ($7/month)
  - OR migrate to new free database
  - OR use external free database

**Plan ahead:** Set a reminder for day 80!

### 3. Monthly Limits
- Backend: 750 hours/month (plenty for testing)
- Frontend: 100GB bandwidth/month (usually enough)

---

## 🚀 Quick Deploy (15 Minutes)

### Step 1: Push to GitHub
```bash
cd /home/maverick/E/Project/Temp/pos
git add .
git commit -m "Ready for free tier deployment"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Deploy on Render
1. Go to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com)
2. Click **"New +"** → **"Blueprint"**
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Render creates everything automatically (using render.yaml)

### Step 3: Set Required Secrets
Go to Backend Service → Environment:
```bash
# Generate: openssl rand -base64 64
JWT_SECRET=<paste-generated-secret>

# Your Gmail
MAIL_USERNAME=your-email@gmail.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=<gmail-app-password>
```

### Step 4: Update URLs
After both services deploy:

**Frontend** → Environment:
```bash
VITE_API_URL=https://pos-backend.onrender.com
```

**Backend** → Environment:
```bash
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://pos-frontend.onrender.com
FRONTEND_RESET_URL=https://pos-frontend.onrender.com/auth/reset-password?token=
```

### Step 5: Redeploy & Test
1. Redeploy both services
2. Test: `https://pos-backend.onrender.com/actuator/health`
3. Open: `https://pos-frontend.onrender.com`
4. 🎉 You're live!

## 🎓 Free Tier Best Practices

### 1. Development Workflow
```bash
# Develop locally
pnpm dev              # Frontend
./mvnw spring-boot:run   # Backend

# Test locally thoroughly
# Only deploy to Render when ready to test live
```

### 2. Keep Backend Awake (Optional)
Set up free ping service:
- [Cron-job.org](https://cron-job.org)
- [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com)
- Ping: `https://your-backend.onrender.com/actuator/health`
- Interval: Every 14 minutes

### 3. Optimize for Free Tier
- Compress frontend assets
- Optimize images (use WebP)
- Keep database lean
- Monitor usage regularly

### 4. Plan for Database
- Set reminder for Day 80
- Decide: Upgrade or migrate?
- Backup data regularly

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Backend is slow to respond"
**Cause:** Service is waking from sleep
**Solution:** Wait 30-60 seconds OR upgrade to $7/month

### "Database connection failed"
**Cause:** Database might be full OR expired
**Solution:** Check Render dashboard for database status

### "Out of hours" error
**Cause:** Used 750+ hours this month
**Solution:** Wait for new month OR upgrade

### "Bandwidth exceeded"
**Cause:** Frontend used 100GB+ bandwidth
**Solution:** Optimize assets OR wait for new month
