## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If you still see errors:

1. **Clear browser cache**:
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Right-click the refresh button
   - Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

2. **Clear all caches**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules/.vite
   rm -rf dist
   pnpm dev
   ```

3. **Check if changes were saved**:
   - Verify `index.html` has the inline script (around line 13-59)
   - Verify `vite.config.js` has the React 19 configuration
   - Verify `src/main.jsx` imports ErrorBoundary

### If Fast Refresh doesn't work:

1. Make sure you cleared the cache: `rm -rf node_modules/.vite`
2. Restart the dev server completely
3. Check that no errors appear in the console during startup
