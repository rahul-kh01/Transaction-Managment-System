## Troubleshooting Reference

### If Backend Fails
1. Check environment variables
2. Review build logs
3. Verify database connection
4. Check Dockerfile syntax
5. Test locally with Docker

### If Frontend Fails
1. Verify `VITE_API_URL`
2. Check build logs
3. Test build locally (`pnpm build`)
4. Verify `package.json` scripts
5. Clear Render build cache

### If API Calls Fail
1. Check CORS configuration
2. Verify backend is running
3. Test backend health endpoint
4. Check browser console for errors
5. Verify `VITE_API_URL` is correct

---

## Quick Commands

### Test Backend Locally
```bash
cd pos-backend
./mvnw spring-boot:run
# or with Docker
docker build -t pos-backend .
docker run -p 5000:5000 --env-file .env pos-backend
```

### Test Frontend Locally
```bash
cd pos-frontend-vite
pnpm install
pnpm dev
# Test production build
pnpm build
pnpm preview
```

### Generate JWT Secret
```bash
openssl rand -base64 64
```

### Check Backend Health
```bash
curl https://your-backend.onrender.com/actuator/health
```
